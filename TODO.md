* fire trails
* hit/miss/crit display

* display detailed gun stats
* ammo
* per-action cooldown system (reset on new_level etc.)
* there's infinite loop during alien turn sometimes (when only dead soldiers are in range)
* a few more randomly generated objects
* low cover objects
* sidearms
* soldiers and aliens in one structure
* basic cover/flanking
* movement trails
* movement by 1.0 / 1.4, not full Euclidean distance (if it works)
* grenades
* aliens preference for cover and for staying close to each other
* level ups (for at least stats)
* full line of sight test for shooting (maybe ignoring covers)
* make rocket work
* make run&gun work
* dashing
* class ability for snipers
* class ability for supports
* the game still has far too many infinite loops, and I don't know how to debug them :-(
* do not constantly empty and recreate sidebar

Overwatch system will be a big upgrade much later
Some not completely stupid level generation as well

Ability tree idea - training roulette pool:
* resilience
* SCOPE
* executioner
* bring em on (needs: squad line of sight)
* HEAT ammo (needs: robotic soldiers)
* grenadier (needs: grenades)
* tactical sense (needs: line of sight)
* aggression (needs: line of sight)
* field medic (needs: per-soldier action system)
* low cover (needs: low cover)
* ammo conservation (needs: ammo)
* alien granades (needs: granades)
* arc thrower (depends on class)
* rocketeer (needs: fire rocket, depends on class)
* gunslinger (needs: pistols)
* headshot (depends on class)
* snapshot (depends on class)
* disabling shot (needs: ammo)
* will to survive (depends on correct flanking system)
